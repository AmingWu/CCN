## Connective Cognition Network for Directional Visual Commonsense Reasoning

![Task](https://github.com/AmingWu/CCN/tree/master/pic/fig1.png "Illustration of our method")
Visual commonsense reasoning (VCR) has been introduced to boost research of cognition-level visual understanding, i.e., a thorough understanding of correlated details of the scene plus an inference with related commonsense knowledge. We propose a connective cognition network (CCN) to dynamically reorganize the visual neuron connectivity that is contextualized by the meaning of questions and answers.
